Interactive Form Validation
Responsive, modern, and user-friendly form validation for web projects

🔥 Project Overview
Interactive Form Validation is a lightweight, accessible, and easy-to-integrate front-end module that demonstrates modern client-side form validation using HTML, CSS (Tailwind optional), and JavaScript.

Custom validation rules for common fields (email, password, phone, username)
Password strength meter and show/hide toggle
Inline error messages and helper text
Accessible (aria attributes, focus styles) and keyboard-friendly
Configurable validation rules (easy to extend)
Works with plain HTML/JS or integrated with frameworks
🧰 Tech Stack

CSS (Tailwind CSS recommended — optional)
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

📦 Installation
Clone the repo:

git clone (https://github.com/aalimabismi/interactive_validation_form.git)
cd interactive-form-validation
Open index.html in your browser or serve with a simple static server:

# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
📝 Usage
Open index.html.
Try submitting empty fields — validation prevents submit and shows helpful messages.
Customize validation rules in script.js.
🔧 Validation Rules (examples)
Username: required, 3–20 characters, letters/numbers/underscore
Email: required, valid email format
Password: required, min 8 chars, includes uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
Confirm Password: must match password
Phone: optional/required depending on form, numeric, 10 digits
You can change these rules inside script.js or extract them into a separate config object for reuse.
